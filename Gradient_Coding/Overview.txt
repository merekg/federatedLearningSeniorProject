# Project Explanation

"""
This project is an implementation of the gradient coding schemes presented in Gradient Coding: Avoiding Stragglers in Synchronous Gradient
Descent by R. Tandon, Q. Lei, et. al. 

The project is foccussed on showing how linear combinations of data partitions can be leveraged to mitigate the effect of stragglers. 
The project can be sorted into two main groups, corresponding to two different gradient coding schemes: Fractional Repetition and Cyclical Repetition.

1. Fractional Repetition (FR) 
    Worker nodes are divided into equal-sized groups. Data partitions are assigned equally and disjointly to worker nodes
    
    To run an FR experiment:
      a. on each worker node
        i. create a node object << python3 node_object.py >>
      b. on the aggregator
        i. create an agg object with FR matrix builder <<  >>

2. Cyclical Repetition (CR)
 a. on each worker node
        i. create a node object << python3 node_object.py >>
      b. on the aggregator
        i. create an agg object with CR matrix builder <<  >>
